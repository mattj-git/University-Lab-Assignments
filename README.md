# University-Lab-Assignments
This repository contains all the code I submitted for my assignments in my second year programming classes.

All of the answers here use either C or java (C files ending in ".c" and java files ending in ".java"

For a bit of background. For these assignments I was given a set of questions and was required to write functions, classes, structures and methods to answer them. At the beginning of each of my answers I commented the question I was being asked, and throughout the code I commented on important lines to give you an idea of my thought process and too explain what the code does.
